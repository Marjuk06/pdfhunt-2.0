PWA Icon Files Required

You need to create the following icon files in the public folder:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can create these using:
- Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Or use a simple logo/image and resize it

For now, you can use any PNG images with these dimensions as placeholders.
The app will work without them, but the install prompt may not show properly.

Optional screenshot files (for better PWA store listings):
- screenshot-1.png (1280x720)
- screenshot-2.png (1280x720)
- screenshot-3.png (1280x720)
